Udacity Nanodegree Submission for Multi-User Blog Project

##Code Summary
  - **app.yaml** - to define app engine parameters
  - **main.py** - Python code responsible for handling http requests
  - **/fonts** - contains glyphicon fonts used in links/buttons
  - **/static** - contains custom css and Bootstrap css and javascript files
  - **/templates** - contains html template files used to display as web pages

##Usage
To run this code, you must first have the Google App Engine SDK for Python installed.

Then you can either run the application through the GAE Launcher GUI

1. File -> Add Existing Application
2. Add project
3. Click Browse

or through the command line
1. Navigate to project directory
2. Run dev_appserver.py ./

I faced lot of issues while deploying this website on GoogleApp SDK.
I'll figure the problems as soon as I get some more time. The code implementation is
working perfectly fine on localhost and all the funtionalities has been implemented as per the project requirements.
